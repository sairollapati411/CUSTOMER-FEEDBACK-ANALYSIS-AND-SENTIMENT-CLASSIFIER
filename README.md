# CUSTOMER-FEEDBACK-ANALYSIS-AND-SENTIMENT-CLASSIFIER
This project focuses on analyzing customer feedback to extract valuable insights and classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. The process involves data preprocessing, such as cleaning text, removing stop words, and tokenization, followed by exploratory analysis to identify common themes and trends

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered customer feedback data and cleaned it by removing noise, stopwords, and performing tokenization and stemming/lemmatization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed feedback to identify key themes, trends, and word frequencies using visualizations like word clouds.

Feature Engineering: Converted text data into numerical formats using techniques like TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or word embeddings.
or advanced models like BERT.
Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure reliability.

Deployment and Reporting: Provided actionable insights on customer sentiment and deployed the model to classify new feedback for real-time analysis
